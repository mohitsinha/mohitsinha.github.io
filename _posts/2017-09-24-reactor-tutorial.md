Reactive programming is about building asynchronous, non-blocking, and 
event-driven applications that can easily scale.

Reactor is a Reactive library for building non-blocking applications. 
It is based on the Reactive Streams Specification. 
Java 8 is required to use this library. It is integrated into Java 9.

Reactive Streams are push-based. 
It is the Publisher that notifies the Subscriber of newly available values as they come, and this push aspect is key to being reactive.
