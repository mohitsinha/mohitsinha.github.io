<p class="lead" markdown="1">I’m Mohit Sinha. I’m a Software Developer at [Turtlemint](http://www.turtlemint.com), where I focus mostly on the back-end.</p>

Prior to that I have worked on different types of projects which enhanced my skill-set in different ways.

I enjoy [writing](/writing/) about things I learn.

One day I might write some articles which will give you more insights on me.
